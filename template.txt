I will be solve questions in this format : Step by Step 

Reasoning: I am not just learning problem solving for OA,s but also for interviewing. In interviewing, you are ranked based on your how do you solve the problem, 
how thorough you are and your communication skill. I find this framework really helpful for that. 


Framework
Step 1: Questions 
Step 2: test cases 
Step 3: Naive solution appraoch - thinking 
Step 4: Code for Naive solution 
Step 5: Check the code for errors
Step 6: Dry run the test cases 
Step 7: Time and Space complexity 
Step 8: Better appraoch for this 
Step 9: Code for better approach 
Step 10 : check the code for errors 
Step 11: Dry run the test cases 
Step 12: Time and Space complexity
